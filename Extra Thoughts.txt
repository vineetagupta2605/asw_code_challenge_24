What changes you would make to this interfaces for use in an RTOS environment?

- When adapting interfaces for use in a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) environment, several considerations has to be taken into account.
a) Thread Safety: Ensure that all functions and data structures are thread-safe, meaning they can be safely accessed and modified by multiple threads concurrently. 
This typically involves adding appropriate synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes, semaphores, or RTOS-specific synchronization primitives to protect critical sections of code and shared resources.
b) Asynchronous Operation: Modify the interfaces to support asynchronous operation. This can be achieved by adding asynchronous read and write functions that utilize RTOS features like event flags, message queues, 
or software timers to signal transaction completion.
c) Priority Inversion and Inheritance Handling: Address priority inversion issues that may arise when higher-priority tasks are blocked by lower-priority tasks waiting on I2C transactions. 
Implement priority inheritance or priority ceiling protocols to prevent priority inversion and ensure timely execution of critical tasks.


How might the I2C API be improved?

a) Provide a high-level interface that abstracts hardware details.
Example: Instead of directly accessing hardware registers, developers use functions like i2c_read() and i2c_write().
b) Have a initilization functions for setting the speed, peripheral, clock, addressing mode.
c) Enhance error reporting and recovery mechanisms.
Example: Return error codes with detailed descriptions and provide functions for error detection and recovery.
